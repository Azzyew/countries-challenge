## Overview

I wanted to use this challenge to both practice my current skills as well as try some new technologies and patterns. I *unfortunately* don't have much experience with unit testing, only e2e testing, so I'm also using this project to dive into it a bit more to hopefully implement it on all my future projects as well

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com)
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

### Continued development

I know that NextJS has a lot more useful tidbits and resources I could use to make this project even better, as well as TanStack Query. They're both libraries/frameworks with a lot of powerful utilities and I know I'm not using them to their full potential, so my goal is to keep improving my knowledge in it

I also highly encourage feedbacks or just discussions about my code, so please feel free to open an issue or contact me!

### Useful resources

- [Dark Mode with TailwindCSS](https://dev.to/naomipham_/how-to-create-darklight-mode-with-react-and-tailwind-59e0) - This helped me to get a better understanding of how to build the dark/light mode with TailwindCSS
- [REST Countries API docs](https://restcountries.com) - Always important to read the docs of the API to better understand its endpoints and field types
